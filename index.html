				<p>Retsuko is an anthropomorphic red panda, 25 years old and single, who works in the accounting department of a Japanese trading firm. Facing constant frustration every day from pushy superiors and annoying co-workers, Retsuko lets out her emotions by going to a karaoke bar every night and singing death metal.[2][3] After five years of working the daily grind, her relationships with her various co-workers are starting to shift, opening up in ways that can change her life for better... or for worse.</p>
